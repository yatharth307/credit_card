# Credit Card Analysis
### This project aims to support PSPD Bank in evaluating key aspects of its credit card operations including bankruptcy, fraud, and collections. By analyzing customer spending and repayment behavior, the project seeks to empower the bank to make informed decisions and proactively respond to customer needs.

# Project Objectives
  * Analyze customer data to adjust for anomalies and unrealistic values.
  * Generate summaries to understand customer spending and repayment patterns.
  * Calculate the bank's monthly profit based on the interest earned on net positive monthly profits.
  * Identify top customers, product types, and spending cities.
  * Visualize spending patterns across different dimensions.
  * Develop a Python function to identify top customers per city based on repayment amount, segmented by product and time period.
    
# Datasets
  * Customer Acquisition: Contains details of customers at the time of card issuance.
  * Spend (Transaction data): Records of credit card spending for each customer.
